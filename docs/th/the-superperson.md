## 🧩 Finding Balance

- **Delegate tasks when possible** - You don't have to do everything alone
- **Set realistic goals** - Focus on what truly matters
- **Take breaks and recharge** - Burnout helps no one
- **Know your limits** - It's okay to say no sometimes
- **Prioritize self-care** - Your wellbeing comes first
