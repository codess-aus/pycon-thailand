# üéØ The Perfectionist

![The Perfectionist](assets/perfectionist.jpg)

The Perfectionist strives for flawless code and never feels satisfied. This can slow progress and increase frustration. This person prepares and reherses and redoes their work, continuously iterating in search of perfection. It can be hard to finish a task, because of that feeling in the back of your mind that this is not good enough.

## üèÜ Embracing Imperfection

- **Mistakes are part of learning** - Each bug teaches you something new
- **Progress over perfection** - Done is better than perfect
- **Review and refactor, but don't obsess** - Set time limits for improvements
- **Ship it!** - Real-world feedback is more valuable than theoretical perfection
