## Storytime

One day I was struggling with my demo's (this was pre-Copilot) and I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I had rebuilt my demo 8 times or more (they say repeating the same steps and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity...)and it still wouldn't work. 

I asked my grad hire - Jiaranai - to take a look at my code. She said "How come you ask me, Michelle, you should ask Graeme, he's the Senior Developer. He will surely know the answer."  

I replied "I asked Graeme yesterday. He did the same things I had done, checked the same things, undertook the same troubleshooting... and he couldn't figure it out."  

Graeme was born in the same decade as I was, he went to University in the same country, studied from the same books (a thing we used before the internet existed), we were taught the same troubleshooting methodology so we solve problems in the same way. It means that even though Jia was much less experienced - she might see things differently, solve things differently.

Jia looked at my code for 30 mins and then she said "There is a capital letter in the file path and not in the code."  

*I learnt 3 things that day:*

- Experience and expertise do not always solve the problem. Diversity of thought comes from seeing things that others do not see, and if you are younger, less experienced, closer to your education ‚Äì you might well pick out the flaws a more senior dev cannot see.
- It wasn‚Äôt because I was a bad coder that I couldn‚Äôt fix my code.
- It is never a mistake to look for help from different sources.
