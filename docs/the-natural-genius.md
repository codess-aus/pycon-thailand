# 🧠 The Natural Genius

The Natural Genius expects to master new skills quickly. When learning takes time, they may feel discouraged. This type typically feels like a fraud because they don't believe that they are naturally intelligent or competent.

## 🌟 Embrace the Process

- **Learning takes time and effort** - Even "naturals" practice extensively
- **Celebrate progress, not perfection** - Small improvements compound over time
- **Everyone learns at their own pace** - Your journey is unique
- **Struggle is part of growth** - Challenges make you stronger
- **Focus on the journey** - Enjoy the process of discovery

When I teach coding to women wanting to change careers, they often suffer from this kind of Imposter Syndrome. They look around and it seems like everyone else understands, everyone else picks it up right away and they listen to that voice in their heads that says "women don't code" or "women don't like to code, they like to do more artistic or social things". I always remind them that No-one ever walks out of the birth canal. It took nearly two years to learn how to walk, to learn how to feed yourself. If humans gave up on day 1 because they couldn't take care of themselves - we would all be long gone by now. Everything worth doing takes time to learn how to do it well. It takes practice. It takes patience. Do a little bit each day and you will get better and better.
