## üå± Growth Mindset

- **Embrace learning as a journey** - There's always something new to discover
- **Ask questions and seek help** - It's a sign of strength, not weakness
- **Share knowledge with others** - Teaching reinforces your own learning
- **It's okay to say "I don't know"** - Then add "but let's find out together"
