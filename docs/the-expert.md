# üßë‚Äçüè´ The Expert

The Expert feels they must know everything - Python, Devops, Infrastructure as Code, Testing, Security - and be able to answer every question on any topic. This mindset can lead to stress and burnout.

## üß† Why It Happens

Experts often set high standards for themselves and fear being seen as less knowledgeable. They believe they need to know everything before they can contribute or teach others.

With GitHub Copilot if you don't understand how something works, you can just ask it. Depending on which model you choose you will see a more verbose or a more succinct explanation. 

The words you choose in your prompt can also frame what the output will look like - so this explanation is quite verbose, but also there is some assumed level of education in there. I could reframe the question asking it to explain it to me like I'm 5 years old. Or to put it in a fun way. Or - to explain it as if I needed to justify this code block to a senior technical decision maker - so it would give me the right words to defend my code if I need to.

You can ask your questions in the context of the file you have open, the lines you have highlighted, the whole repository, a specific folder.  

I want all the images in this repository to be styled consistently, responsively and accessibly - so I might ask it to check my code and confirm the way I have written it meets those standards, and if it doesn't - explain to me how I can rewrite it so it does that.

## üå± Growth Mindset

- **Embrace learning as a journey** - There's always something new to discover
- **Ask questions and seek help** - It's a sign of strength, not weakness
- **Share knowledge with others** - Teaching reinforces your own learning
- **It's okay to say "I don't know"** - Then add "but let's find out together"
