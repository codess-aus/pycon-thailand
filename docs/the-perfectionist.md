## üèÜ Embracing Imperfection

- **Mistakes are part of learning** - Each bug teaches you something new
- **Progress over perfection** - Done is better than perfect
- **Review and refactor, but don't obsess** - Set time limits for improvements
- **Ship it!** - Real-world feedback is more valuable than theoretical perfection
