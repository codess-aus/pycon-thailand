But I still remember how hard it was earlier in my career to ask for help and how much it would have helped me if I had someone I could turn to without judgement.

I had rebuilt my demo 8 times or more (they say repeating the same steps and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity...)and it still wouldn't work. </p> <p>I asked my grad hire - Jiaranai - to take a look at my code. She said \"How come you ask me, Michelle, you should ask Graeme, he's the Senior Developer. He will surely know the answer.\"  </p> <p>I replied \"I asked Graeme yesterday. He did the same things I had done, checked the same things, undertook the same troubleshooting... and he couldn't figure it out.\"  </p> <p>Jia looked at my code for 30 mins and then she said \"There is a capital letter in the file path and not in the code.\"  </p> <p>I learnt 3 things that day:</p> <ul> <li>Experience and expertise do not always solve the problem. Diversity of thought comes from seeing things that others do not see, and if you are younger, less experienced, closer to your education \u2013 you might well pick out the flaws a more senior dev cannot see.</li> <li>It wasn\u2019t because I was a bad coder that I couldn\u2019t fix my code.</li> <li>It is never a mistake to look for help from different sources. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"key-takeaways/#what-weve-learned","title":"\ud83c\udfaf What We've Learned","text":"<ul> <li>Everyone experiences doubts\u2014it's normal!
